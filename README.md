Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
• The client, DriverPass, is looking to have a system developed for training students to pass their driving test at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV). Including online classes, practice test, and the ability to make reservations for in-person on-the-road training.

What did you do particularly well?
• I felt my UML Diagrams properly refeclted different aspects of the system. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
• I would like to spend more time on nonfunctional requirements. I believe I am lacking in properly describing the areas of performance, plaftorm, and accuracy and precision.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
• I defined my users needs as objects and goals. These objects and goals were used to create process flows and build the various use cases of the system.
• It is important to consider the user's needs when designing, as a system that does not meet reflects badly on you the developer or the business providing the product. It is a loss of money, time, and resources as the system will more the likely go unused.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
• My approach to designing software is through requirements gathering, from there, development of use cases. Once some use cases are developed, researching into already existing solutions. This creates more use cases. Then development of process flows and activity, sequence, and class diagrams.
• Creation of process flows will play a vital role in the future. I believe process flows will help me better recognize the different components to a system and further develop use cases. Process Flows will help me create a level of organization within the SDLC to learn and grow from.
